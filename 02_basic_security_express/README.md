# In this demo we're going to create a secure express API  

We'll start from __web-security-fundamentals\02_basic_security_express\00_start_code__ code. We can check that our API is by following the next steps:


From root solution folder:

```bash
npm i
npm start
```

Open another bash terminal and type.

```
curl localhost:3050/api/cars
```
